# wp-moody
Use [cognitive resources](https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net) to give a personality over view of a blog post's author at the time of creation. Updating posts should also update these metrics.

This wordpress plugin would report on an authors general mood base do on `Watson` making cognitive decisions on their posts.

Project would require:
 - [IBM Bluemix Account](https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net)
 - personality insights credentials

## End Result
Plugin would give the author/owner of a blog post or page the ability to see, graphically, their current personality traits. This can be set on a per post/page basis or the user can set it to use all posts collectively over time. Default setting should be on a post/page basis.

One possible outcome of this, should an author be happy to let the data gathered by the `Bluemix Personality Insights API`, ie watson, then a marker/flag/tagging system might be plausible - a popular blogger's website could cognitively state whether or not the post is an `angry rant` or `happy rave` and an end user could see the authors 'mood'. Post author's would also be able to track their mood at time of creation to popular posts etc.

The advantage here of using cognitive computing against data collected over time is that results will greatly tailored to the individual, rather than the norm. Should the plugin be set to make results on a per post/page basis then the results could only ever be based on comparing the author to the population. In this case it wouldn't be possible or feasable to have an authors `mood` advertised as marker/flag/tagging and the plugin should just retire its metrics to the authors viewing only.
